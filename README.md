## COMP-251: Algorithms and Data Structures

- These assignments were part of **COMP 251** - Algorithms and Data Structures Course at **McGill University**.
- Final Grade: **A**

---

### Assignment 1: **Hash Tables, Disjoint Sets, and String Processing**  
Covered **hashing techniques** (chaining and open addressing) and **union-find data structures** with optimizations like union by rank and path compression. Explored efficient string processing and sorting algorithms for text analysis and frequency determination.

---

### Assignment 2: **Search, Dynamic Programming, and Divide & Conquer**  
Focused on **complete search algorithms** for exhaustive problem-solving, **dynamic programming** for optimization problems, and **greedy strategies** for scheduling. Also included **divide and conquer techniques** to solve recursive problems efficiently without building entire structures.

---

### Assignment 3: **Graph Algorithms and Flow Networks**  
Covered **graph traversal (BFS)** for shortest path problems, **topological sorting** for dependency resolution, and the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** for calculating maximum flow in weighted graphs. Emphasized efficient graph representations and real-world applications of advanced graph algorithms.
