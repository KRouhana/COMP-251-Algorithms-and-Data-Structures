### **Problem and Question Summary**
#### **Question 1: Complete Search**  
- **Problem:** Solve a game where balls jump over each other into holes to minimize the number of remaining balls on the board.
- **Task:** Implement a recursive algorithm to determine the minimum number of balls left and the minimum number of moves to achieve this.

#### **Question 2: Dynamic Programming**  
- **Problem:** Select weights from a set such that their combined weight is closest to 1000.
- **Task:** Use dynamic programming to find the optimal solution, favoring larger weights in case of ties.

#### **Question 3: Greedy Algorithm**  
- **Problem:** Schedule homework to maximize the total weight of completed assignments before their deadlines.
- **Task:** Implement a greedy algorithm that sorts and prioritizes homework based on their weights and deadlines.

#### **Question 4: Divide and Conquer**  
- **Problem:** Retrieve the K-th letter from the N-th Fibonacci sequence defined with strings instead of numbers.
- **Task:** Develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm to directly access the required letter without constructing the full sequence.
